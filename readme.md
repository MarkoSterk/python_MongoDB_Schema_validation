A custom mongoDB Schema module with validation somewhat inspired by the popular Mongoose module for NodeJS(ExpressJS).
The base class Model in model.py can be used to create custom schema classes (example in postModel.py). 
The validator.py file contains validation methods in the Validator class which can be used to validate different 
input fields. Custom validation methods can be easily added be adhering to the design of existing methods in the Validator class.

Feel free to try the module.

This Schema validation is used on my own website www.markosterk.com
